# Distributed TensorFlow

This directory contains the initial open-source implementation of the
distributed TensorFlow runtime, using [gRPC](http://grpc.io) for inter-process
communication.

To learn how to use the distributed runtime to create a TensorFlow cluster,
see the "Distributed TensorFlow" How To, which is available [in this
repository](../../g3doc/how_tos/distributed/index.md), and will be available
on the TensorFlow website after the next version is released.
